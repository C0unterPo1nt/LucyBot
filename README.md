| Echo |  Will respond with the passed `message` whenever a user writes `!echo message` |
| Admin-commands | Adds commands such as `!kick @user`, `!ban @user`, `!mute @user`, `!unmute @user` and `!purge` that can be used to manage the userbase and messages of a server |

#### How to build plugins

The plugins are ES6 classes with a static method `name` that will help identify the plugin.

The constructor of each plugin will be invoked receive an instance of a [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) client when it's first loaded. Check the [discord.js documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Message) for more details about what's possible to access within the client.

`enable` and `disable` methods, if provided, will be called whenever the plugin is enabled or disabled.

**Example plugin:**

```js

class ExamplePlugin {
    static get name() {
        return 'example-plugin';
    }
    
    constructor(client) {
        // The plugin is being created
    }
    
    enable() {
        // The plugins has been enabled
    }
    
    disable() {
        // The plugin has been disabled
    }
}
```
